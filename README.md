**Edison Community Ruler**

What is the Project About? üéØ
It‚Äôs a custom format for EDOPro designed to:

Revive the spirit of the original Edison format (April 2010), renowned for its balance and strategic depth.

Incorporate modern cards in a controlled way (up to 2013 or later with caution), but without broken mechanics like Pendulum or Link.

Empower the community: Players vote on allowed cards, bans, and rule evolution.

How Does It Work? üõ†Ô∏è
Allowed Mechanics:
‚úÖ Synchro: The core of the original format.
‚úÖ Fusion: From classics (Gladiator Beasts) to balanced modern versions.
‚ùå Excluded: XYZ, Pendulum, Link, and any post-2010 mechanics.

Allowed Cards:
Initial Phase: Only cards released up to January 1, 2013.

Advanced Phase: Post-2013 cards (2014-2023) will be evaluated individually, provided they:

Do not disrupt the format‚Äôs balance.

Empower weak archetypes or add diversity.

Community Voting System:
Dynamic Banlist: The community decides banned/limited cards through polls.

New Card Proposals: Players can suggest modern cards, which are tested in trial duels before approval.

Key Rules:
No Powercreep: Overly fast effects or 1-card combo enablers are banned (e.g., generic searchers).

Interaction-First: Cards that require resource management and strategy are prioritized (e.g., Level 4 monsters with modest effects).

Practical Example ‚öîÔ∏è
Player A: Uses a Six Samurai deck with modern supports (up to 2013) to quickly summon Synchros like Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En.

Player B: Counters with updated Gladiator Beasts, using classic Fusions like Heraklinos alongside 2012 supports for consistency.

Result: Slow, tactical duels where resource management and limited interruptions decide the winner.
